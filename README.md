Media-Streaming-Platform

Media-Streaming-Platform is a video streaming application built with React and Firebase. The app allows users to browse and watch their favorite TV shows and movies in a seamless and intuitive interface.

I developed this project as part of an initiative to create a new flagship product for my company, and I'm proud to say that Media-Streaming-Platform
met all the requirements and exceeded expectations. This project showcases my skills in front-end development, particularly in creating dynamic and engaging user interfaces.

Feel free to explore the code and try the app yourself by visiting [media-streaming-platform.netlify.app]. Any feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated.
